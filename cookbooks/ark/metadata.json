This is a\nmodified  verion of Infochimps awesome install_from cookbook\n [http://github.com/infochimps-cookbooks/install_from]. It has been\n heavily refactored and extended to meet different use cases.\n\nGiven a project `pig`, with url `http://apache.org/pig/pig-0.8.0.tar.gz`, and\nthe default :path of `/usr/local`, this provider will\n\n* fetch  it to to `/var/cache/chef/`\n* unpack it to :path  (`/usr/local/pig-0.8.0`)\n* create a symlink for :home_dir (`/usr/local/pig`) pointing to :path\n* add specified binary commands to the enviroment PATH variable\n\nBy default, the ark will not run again if the :path is not\nempty. Ark provides many actions to accommodate different use cases,\nsuch as :dump, :cherry_pick, :put, and :install_with_make.\n\nAt this time ark only handles files available from URLs. It does not\nhandle local files.\n\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\nYou can customize the basic attributes to meet your organization's conventions\n\n* default[:ark][:apache_mirror] = 'http://apache.mirrors.tds.net'\n\n\nResources/Providers\n===================\n\n* ark - does the extract/build/configure dance\n\nActions \n=======\n\n- :install: extracts the file and creates a 'friendly' symbolic link\n  to the extracted directory path\n- :configure: configure ahead of the install action\n- :install_with_make: extracts the archive to a path, runs make, and\n  make install. It does _not_ run the configure step at this time\n- :dump: strips all directories from the archive and dumps the\n  contained files into a specified path\n- :cherry_pick: extract a specified file from an archive and places\n  in specified path\n- :put: extract the archive to a specified path, does not create any\n  symbolic links\n- :remove: removes the extracted directory and related symlink #TODO\n\n# :put\n\n## Relevant Attribute Parameters\n\n- path: path to extract to, defaults to '/usr/local'\n- has_binaries: array of binary commands to symlink to\n  /usr/local/bin/, you must specify the relative path example: [ 'bin/java', 'bin/javaws' ]\n- append_env_path: boolean, if true, append the ./bin directory of the\n  extracted directory to the global PATH variable for all users\n\n# :dump\n\n\nNOTE: This currently only works for zip archives\n\n## Relevant Attribute Parameters\n\n- path: path to dump files to \n- mode: file mode for app_home, is an integer\n- creates: if you are appending files to a given directory, ark\n  needs a condition to test whether the file has already been\n  extracted. You can specify with creates, a file whose existence\n  indicates the ark has previously been extracted and does not need to\n  be extracted again\n\n# :cherry_pick\n\n\n## Relevant Attribute Parameters\n\n- path: directory to place file in\n- creates: specific file to cherry-pick\n\n\nark\n===\n\n# Attribute Parameters\n\n- name: name of the package, defaults to the resource name\n- url: url for tarball, .tar.gz, .bin (oracle-specific), .war, and .zip\n  currently supported. Also supports special syntax\n  :name:version:apache_mirror: that will auto-magically construct\n  download url from the apache mirrors site\n- version: software version, defaults to \"1\" if not specified. The :dump, :cherry_pick, and :put actions do not use it\n- extension: The file extension of the file you are trying to\n  download. If not specified, ark tries to determine the file\n  extension by parsing the URL\n- checksum: sha256 checksum, used for security \n- mode: file mode for app_home, is an integer TODO\n- prefix_root: default prefix_root, for use with :install* actions\n- prefix_home: default directory prefix for a friendly symlink to the path, for\n  example  /usr/local/maven -> /usr/local/maven-2.2.1\n- prefix_bin: default directory to place a symlink to a binary\n  command, example /opt/bin/mvn ->\n  /opt/maven-2.2.1/bin/mvn , where the prefix_bin is \"/opt/bin\"\n- path: path to extract the ark to, by default is\n  /usr/local/<name>-<version> for the :install, :install_with_make actions\n  the :install* actions overwrite any user-provided values for :path\n- home_dir: symbolic link to the path :prefix_root/:name-:version,\n  defaults to :prefix_root/:name , , does not apply to :dump, :put, or\n  :cherry_pick actions\n- has_binaries: array of binary commands to symlink to\n  /usr/local/bin/, you must specify the relative path example: [ 'bin/java', 'bin/javaws' ]\n- append_env_path: boolean, similar to has_binaries but less granular\n  - If true, append the ./bin directory of the extracted directory to\n  the PATH environment  variable for all users, does this by placing a file in /etc/profile.d/ which will be read by all users\n  be added to the path. The commands are symbolically linked to\n  /usr/bin/* . Examples are mvn, java, javac, etc. This option\n  provides more granularity than the boolean option\n- environment: hash of environment variables to pass to invoked shell\n  commands like tar, unzip, configure, and make\n- strip_leading_dir: by default, ark strips the leading directory from\n  an archive, which is the default for both unzip and tar commands \n- autoconf_opts: an array of command line options for use with the GNU\n  autoconf script\n- make_opts: an array of command line options for use with make\n- owner: owner of extracted directory, set to \"root\" by default\n\n# Examples\n\n     # install Apache Ivy dependency resolution tool\n     ark \"ivy\" do\n       url 'http://someurl.example.com/ivy.tar.gz'\n       version '2.2.0'        \n       checksum '89ba5fde0c596db388c3bbd265b63007a9cc3df3a8e6d79a46780c1a39408cb5'\n       action :install\n     end\n    \nThis example copies ivy.tar.gz to /var/cache/chef/ivy-2.2.0.tar.gz,\nunpacks its contents to /usr/local/ivy-2.2.0/ -- stripping the\nleading directory, and symlinks /usr/local/ivy to /usr/local/ivy-2.2.0\n\n\n     ark 'jdk' do\n       url 'http://download.example.com/jdk-7u2-linux-x64.tar.gz'\n       version '7.2'\n       path \"/usr/local/jvm/\"\n       home_dir \"/usr/local/jvm/default\" \n       checksum  '89ba5fde0c596db388c3bbd265b63007a9cc3df3a8e6d79a46780c1a39408cb5'\n       append_env_path true\n       owner 'foobar'\n     end\n\nThis example copies jdk-7u2-linux-x64.tar.gz to /var/cache/chef/jdk-7.2.tar.gz,\nunpacks its contents to /usr/local/jvm/jdk-7.2/ -- stripping the\nleading directory, symlinks /usr/local/jvm/default to\n/usr/local/jvm/jdk-7.2, and adds /usr/local/jvm/jdk-7.2/bin/ to\nthe global PATH for all users.
